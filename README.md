# react-testing-antipatterns

This is a collection of [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) antipatterns.

The intent is to demonstrate revising the code to follow best practices.

The `fixed` branch has best practices applied.

Scaffolded with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
